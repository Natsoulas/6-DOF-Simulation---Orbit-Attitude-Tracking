# 6-DOF-Simulation---Orbit-Attitude-Tracking
This is a 6-DOF Spacecraft Orbit and Attitude Simulation that utilizes two controller (1 for orbit &amp; 1 for attitude), one simplex optimization method implementation, a PWPF modulator, and ode45 (RK 4-5) numerical integration to simulate a closed-loop control system for the given desired attitude, orbit, and initial conditions of just about any particular Space Mission the user chooses.
